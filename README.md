Vision is a cryptocurrency dashboard built with React and hosted on AWS using S3 and CloudFront. The backend consists of API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB.

This project's aim to let users view live and historical prices of cryptocurrencies and trending news about crypto and blockchain technologies. Users can also create an account to like and save their favorite cryptocurrencies and news articles which they can access from anywhere.

## Technologies used

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) as the React framework
- [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory) for React chart components
- [Swiper.js](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper) for hardware accelerated touch transitions & 3D effects on mobile
- [React-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) for server state management
- [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js) for interfacing with backend cloud infrastructure

## How to navigate this project

- [Stateful business logic](./utils/Context)
- [Components and co-located styles (with CSS Modules)](./components)

- [Example API data transformation](./components/sections/Home/CryptoCardBase.js)

- [Cypress E2E test sample](./cypress/integration/test.spec.js)

## My workflow

- I created issues and pull requests for every code change to try and simulate a professional Git workflow

- Each feature branch merged into the production-ready `main` branch triggers an AWS Code Build CI/CD job to push the production build to S3 and invalidates the CloudFront cache

- Most of the backend infrastructure is declaratively provisioned using CloudFormation templates which are generated by AWS Amplify's CLI tool. The infrastructure-as-code templates are also checked into version control and deployed in the CI/CD pipeline

- I setup and wrote a test samples using Cypress for E2E tests as well as Testing Library/Jest for integration tests. I also used [Mock Service Worker](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) to intercept and return mocked responses to network calls while developing

## Features

- Complete user auth flow:

  - Create account
  - Sign in to account
  - Remember Device
  - Forgot password reset request to email
  - Forgot password confirmation code submit
  - Delete account and user data

- Implements CRUD functionality with authenticated Amazon API Gateway REST API calls to AWS Lambda to spin up an ephemeral function container to handle the request. AWS Lambda makes calls to the DynamoDB database and formats the data to send back to the client thru API Gateway. All of the backend infrastructure is serverless which makes for an on-demand, pay-per-request billing model.

  - Like a news article or cryptocurrency to save it to the database and unlike it to delete
  - Saves the current state of the profile (e.g which tab you were on last) to the database for the client to load server on subsequent visits

- Uses WebSocket feeds for the real-time crypto ticker price updates from the [Coinbase Pro API](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/docs/overview) - [Example](./components/layouts/LiveChartPage.js)
